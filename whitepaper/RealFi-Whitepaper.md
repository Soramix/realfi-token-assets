## Abstract  
RealFi™ is a consumer-focused Web3 ecosystem integrating three native tokens — BitBurnX (BBRX), RealFi Token (RLF), and SoraMix (SRMX).  
Our mission is to bridge Web2 users into Web3 by combining easy wallet access, consumer-centric dApps, NFT experiences, and transparent token economics.  
This whitepaper explains our vision, tokenomics, distribution, roadmap, and governance.

## 1. Introduction  
Traditional finance and existing crypto ecosystems often leave users facing complexity, high fees, and limited utility.  
RealFi™ aims to simplify access to digital assets by offering:  
- Seamless wallet onboarding via Particle Network.  
- A consumer-friendly portal for token purchases, claims, and rewards.  
- Integrated ecosystem tokens (BBRX, RLF, SRMX) serving different functions.  
- Real-world inspired storytelling and gamification (e.g., SoraMix IP dolls).  

Our goal is to make Web3 usable, fun, and rewarding for everyday users.

## 2. Problem  
- **Complex Onboarding:** Wallets and seed phrases are barriers for new users.  
- **Fragmented Ecosystems:** Many tokens lack real utility or cross-integration.  
- **Trust Deficit:** Retail users face scams, rug pulls, and opaque tokenomics.  
- **Limited Creativity:** Few ecosystems combine finance with consumer entertainment (NFTs, collectibles, wearables).

## 3. Solution  
RealFi™ addresses these issues with a unified ecosystem:  
- **Simplified Onboarding:** Particle wallet integration, Web2-style login.  
- **Utility Tokens:** Each token (BBRX, RLF, SRMX) has clear use cases.  
- **Fair Presale Model:** Transparent contracts deployed on BNB Smart Chain.  
- **Entertainment + Finance:** SRMX IP dolls + wearable devices extend into metaverse storytelling.  
- **Ecosystem Portal:** Users can buy, claim, stake, and interact from one place.
